# QueueUp API Contract v1

This document defines the `/api/v1/` REST API contract for QueueUp and the deployment architecture for the frontend/backend split.

---

## Base URL

```
/api/v1/
```

All endpoints are relative to this base. The API uses Django session authentication via cookies.

---

## Authentication and Authorization

### Session Authentication
- Django session cookie-based authentication (standard `sessionid` cookie)
- CSRF token required for all state-changing requests (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Session middleware must be enabled

### User States
1. **Anonymous**: No session or unauthenticated
2. **Pending**: Authenticated but `profile.approved == False`
3. **Approved Player**: Authenticated, active, `profile.approved == True`
4. **Staff**: Authenticated, active, `is_staff == True` or `is_superuser == True`

### Authorization Decorators
- `@api_user_required`: Requires authenticated + active user. Approval required unless `allow_pending=True`
- `@api_user_required(allow_pending=True)`: Requires authenticated + active user, but allows pending/unapproved
- `@api_staff_required`: Requires staff/superuser (implies `@api_user_required`)
- `@api_methods('GET', 'POST', ...)`: Restricts HTTP methods

### CSRF Behavior
- **Required**: All POST, PATCH, DELETE requests via session auth
- **Exempt**: Only `/profile/picture/upload/` (web route, NOT `/api/v1/`) - for iPhone/HEIF compatibility
- **API**: All `/api/v1/` mutations require CSRF token
- **Headers**: `X-CSRFToken` header or `csrfmiddlewaretoken` form field

---

## Response Format

### Success
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human readable message"
  }
}
```

Additional error fields may be included (e.g., `errors` for form validation).

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK`: Success
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `403 Forbidden`: Authorization denied (approved, staff, self-protection)
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `405 Method Not Allowed`: Wrong HTTP method
- `502 Bad Gateway`: External service failure (e.g., Spotify API)

---

## Approval and Access Restrictions

### Session Endpoint (`/api/v1/session/`)
- **Requires**: Authenticated + active user
- **Pending users allowed**: YES - returns `approved: false` in response
- **Anonymous**: 401 Unauthorized
- **Approved users**: returns `approved: true`

### Pending/Unapproved Users
- Can authenticate (`/api/v1/session/`)
- Can check onboarding state (`/api/v1/onboarding/`)
- CANNOT access most endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- Must be approved by staff via `/api/v1/staff/players/<pk>/action/` with `action: approve`

### Approved Players
- Can access all player endpoints
- CANNOT access staff endpoints (403)

### Staff/Superusers
- Can access all endpoints including staff endpoints
- Self-protection: Cannot deactivate or remove own staff access

---

## Endpoint Inventory

### Session / Foundation

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/` | Required | API index/health |
| GET | `/api/v1/session/` | Required (pending ok) | Current session info |

### Native Authentication

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/csrf/` | Anonymous | Issue a CSRF token and cookie |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login/` | Anonymous | Authenticate with a username and password |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/signup/` | Anonymous | Create an account and establish a session |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout/` | Authenticated (pending ok) | End the current session |

Authentication uses Django sessions; these endpoints do not issue JWTs or API
tokens. All POST requests require the CSRF token from the `csrftoken` cookie
(the configured cookie name may differ) in the `X-CSRFToken` header.

`/api/v1/auth/login/` accepts `{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }`.
Successful login returns the same session data shape documented below.

`/api/v1/auth/signup/` accepts:

```json
{
  "display_name": "Alice",
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "password": "...",
  "password_confirm": "...",
  "agree_to_terms": true
}
```

Terms must be explicitly accepted with the JSON boolean `true`. Successful
signup logs the user in, but the new user's `approved` value remains `false`
until staff approval. Login and signup validation failures use the standard
error envelope with an additional `errors` object containing Django form
field errors.

Successful logout returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {"authenticated": false, "user": null}
}
```

**`/api/v1/session/` Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "authenticated": true,
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alice",
      "display_name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "approved": true,
      "is_staff": false,
      "is_superuser": false
    }
  }
}
```

Round summaries include these dashboard card fields:

```json
{
  "submission_count": 3,
  "rating_count": 6,
  "host": {
    "display_name": "Jerry",
    "picture_url": "/media/profile_pictures/2026/08/avatar.jpg"
  }
}
```

`rating_count` is the total number of Vote records for the round, matching the
web Home card's Ratings metric. `host` is `null` when no host is assigned;
`host.picture_url` is nullable when the host has no profile picture.

---

### Player Read Endpoints

All require `@api_user_required` (authenticated + approved).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/dashboard/` | Current round + recent results |
| GET | `/api/v1/seasons/` | List of seasons |
| GET | `/api/v1/archive/` | Archived rounds |
| GET | `/api/v1/seasons/<id>/recap/` | Authenticated player's season recap |
| GET | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/` | Round detail |
| GET | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/ballot/` | Voting ballot |
| GET | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/results/` | Round results (after reveal) |
| GET | `/api/v1/leaderboard/` | Season leaderboard |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/<username>/` | User profile |
| GET | `/api/v1/profiles/<username>/achievements/` | User achievements |

### Season recap

`GET /api/v1/seasons/<id>/recap/` returns the authenticated player's existing
season recap read model. It never returns another player's recap. The response
uses the normal success envelope and includes `season`, structured `slides`,
`summary`, and `viewed` fields. Song values are native track objects; standing
values include `player`, `score`, `place`, `tied`, and `place_label`.

The recap is available only when the season has ended, every non-draft round is
revealed, and the player either submitted in the season or cast at least one
counted vote. A missing season returns `404 season_not_found`; an ineligible or
not-yet-available recap returns `404 recap_unavailable`. Anonymous requests
return `401 authentication_required`; pending users receive `403
approval_required`.

Opening the endpoint marks the recap viewed on the server, matching the web
page-load behavior. The recap remains retrievable after it is viewed. The
successful response's `viewed` value is `true` because the endpoint has just
recorded the view.

Archive responses also include a `seasons` collection. Each season has the
normal season summary plus a personal field:

```json
"recap": {"available": true, "viewed": false}
```

`available` is independent of `viewed` and uses the same recap eligibility
logic.

### Dashboard countdowns

`GET /api/v1/dashboard/` includes a `countdowns` collection before the round
card data is consumed by the native Home screen:

```json
"countdowns": [
  {
    "id": 12,
    "title": "Season finale",
    "target_at": "2026-09-15T20:00:00+00:00",
    "state": "counting_down"
  }
]
```

The collection contains the same player-visible countdown as the web Home:
the newest record with `active: true`, ordered by `updated_at` descending and
primary key descending. If no active record exists it is empty. Target times
are timezone-aware ISO 8601 timestamps. An active countdown remains in the
collection after its target time with `state: "expired"`, matching the web's
“It's time!” behavior. Countdown fields are limited to the id, title, target
timestamp, and presentation state; admin creator and management fields are
not exposed. The collection is additive and does not change the existing
dashboard cards or anonymous/authentication behavior.

### Submissions / Spotify

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/spotify/search/` | Required | Search Spotify tracks |
| GET | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/submission/` | Required | Submission status for round |
| POST | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/submissions/` | Required | Create submission |

**`/api/v1/spotify/search/` Query Params:**
- `q`: Search query (string, min 2 chars)
- `round`: Optional round ID for duplicate checking

**`/api/v1/spotify/search/` Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "tracks": [
      {
        "id": "spotify-track-id",
        "uri": "spotify:track:...",
        "url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/...",
        "title": "Song Title",
        "artist": "Artist Name",
        "artist_ids": ["artist-id-1", "artist-id-2"],
        "album": "Album Name",
        "art": "https://i.scdn.co/image/...",
        "preview": "https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/..." | "",
        "explicit": false,
        "isrc": "USABC1234567" | "",
        "used": true,
        "available": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Duplicate availability fields:**
- `used`: true if ISRC matches an existing submission in the round
- `available`: true if not used (can be submitted)

**`/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/submissions/` Request Body:**
```json
{
  "track_id": "spotify-track-id"
}
```

---

### Voting

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/rounds/<pk>/votes/<submission_id>/` | Required | Save vote |

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "score": 3
}
```

---

### Profile / Onboarding / Media / Push

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/onboarding/` | Required (pending ok) | Onboarding state |
| POST | `/api/v1/onboarding/season-welcome/` | Required | Acknowledge season welcome |
| POST | `/api/v1/onboarding/voting-guide/` | Required | Acknowledge voting guide |
| POST | `/api/v1/onboarding/submission-rules/` | Required | Accept submission rules |
| POST | `/api/v1/profile/` | Required | Update the authenticated user's display name and/or email |
| POST,DELETE | `/api/v1/profile/picture/` | Required | Set/remove profile picture |
| GET | `/api/v1/notifications/` | Required | Get notification preferences |
| POST,DELETE | `/api/v1/push/subscriptions/` | Required | Manage push subscriptions |

**`/api/v1/profile/` Request:**

The request body is a JSON object. Both fields are optional, so a partial update
may change either field independently:

```json
{
  "display_name": "Alice Updated",
  "email": "alice.updated@example.com"
}
```

`display_name` is trimmed and must be non-empty when supplied. `email` is
trimmed and validated with Django's email field validation. Omitting a field
preserves its current value. `username` is read-only and is ignored if sent.
There is no application-level email uniqueness rule; changing an email does not
check it against other users.

Successful updates return the authoritative current profile data:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "display_name": "Alice Updated",
    "email": "alice.updated@example.com",
    "picture_url": "/media/profile_pictures/2026/08/avatar.jpg"
  }
}
```

Invalid JSON returns `400` with `error.code` `invalid_json`. Validation errors
return `400` with `error.code` `invalid_profile`, the first human-readable
message in `error.message`, and field errors in `error.errors`, for example:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_profile",
    "message": "Enter a valid email address.",
    "errors": {
      "email": [{"message": "Enter a valid email address.", "code": "invalid"}]
    }
  }
}
```

### Staff Read Endpoints

All require `@api_staff_required` (authenticated + staff/superuser).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/` | League overview with counts + QR code |
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/` | List all rounds with search |
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/status/` | Per-round player participation |
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/players/` | List all players with search |
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/badges/` | List all badges with search |
| GET | `/api/v1/staff/seasons/` | List all seasons |
| GET,POST | `/api/v1/staff/countdowns/` | List or create homepage countdowns |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/countdowns/<pk>/` | Edit a homepage countdown |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/staff/countdowns/<pk>/` | Delete a homepage countdown |
| GET,POST | `/api/v1/staff/notifications/` | List blast history or create/send/schedule a blast |

**`/api/v1/staff/` Response:** Includes `playlist_url` always for staff.

**Search Endpoints:**
- Players: search by username, first_name, last_name, email
- Badges: search by name, description, achievement_key
- Rounds: search by prompt, details, season name

Each round in the staff rounds response, and the round object returned by the
staff round create/edit endpoints, includes the editable read fields below in
addition to the existing fields:

```json
{
  "goes_live_at": "2026-08-18T09:00:00-04:00",
  "submission_opens": "2026-08-18T10:00:00-04:00",
  "submission_deadline": "2026-08-20T10:00:00-04:00",
  "voting_deadline": "2026-08-22T10:00:00-04:00",
  "reveal_at": "2026-08-22T10:05:00-04:00",
  "host": {
    "id": 7,
    "username": "jerry",
    "display_name": "Jerry",
    "picture_url": "/media/profile_pictures/2026/08/avatar.jpg"
  }
}
```

All schedule fields are returned as timezone-aware ISO 8601 timestamps. The
`goes_live_at` field is nullable; the other schedule fields are required by the
Round model and are non-null. `host` is `null` when no host is assigned, and
`host.picture_url` is nullable when the host has no profile picture.

---

### Staff Command Endpoints

All require `@api_staff_required`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/create/` | Create round |
| POST,PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/` | Edit round |
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/action/` | Lifecycle action |
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/archive/` | Archive round |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/delete/` | Delete round |
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/rounds/<pk>/playlist/` | Create Spotify playlist |
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/players/<pk>/action/` | User membership action |
| POST,PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/badges/create/` | Create badge |
| POST,PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/badges/<pk>/` | Edit badge |
| POST | `/api/v1/staff/badges/<badge_pk>/award/<user_pk>/` | Toggle badge award |
| POST,PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/seasons/create/` | Create season |
| POST,PATCH | `/api/v1/staff/seasons/<pk>/` | Edit season |

### Staff countdown management

These endpoints are staff-only and use the standard session authentication,
CSRF, and `{ok, data}` envelope. Countdown request fields are `title`,
`target_at`, and `active`. `target_at` accepts an ISO 8601 timestamp and is
normalized with the same timezone behavior as the web `HomepageCountdownForm`.
The response contains the authoritative countdown with `id`, `title`,
`target_at`, `active`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. The newest active
countdown remains the one exposed to players, using the existing
`updated_at`, then primary-key ordering. DELETE permanently removes the
countdown, matching the web control action; it does not deactivate it.

Validation failures return HTTP 400 with `error.code` `validation_failed` and
field-level `error.errors` data. Missing records use the existing API 404
behavior.

### Staff notification blasts

`GET /api/v1/staff/notifications/` returns recent blast history in
`data.notifications`. Each item exposes the existing blast fields needed by
League Control: `id`, `title`, `body`, `destination`, `audience`, `status`,
`scheduled_for`, `created_at`, `sent_at`, and `delivery_count`.

`POST /api/v1/staff/notifications/` accepts `title`, `body`, optional
`destination` (default `/home/`), optional `audience` (currently `approved`),
and optional `scheduled_for`. A future timezone-aware timestamp creates a
`scheduled` blast for the existing scheduler. Omitting `scheduled_for`, or
using `action: "send_now"`, creates and immediately sends a blast through the
existing claim/delivery service. The send response contains
`data.notification` and `data.delivery` totals. API clients must not send to
push tokens directly. Delivery uses the stable event key
`admin-blast:<blast_id>`, preserving per-device duplicate protection.

Notification validation failures use HTTP 400 with `error.code`
`validation_failed` and field-level `error.errors` data. All notification
endpoints are staff-only; anonymous requests return 401 and authenticated
non-staff requests return 403. POST, PATCH, and DELETE require CSRF.
